Consider a scenario of demand paged memory. Page table is held in registers. It takes 8 milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replaced page is not modified and 20 milliseconds 
if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100 nanoseconds. Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time. Generate a solution to find maximum acceptable page-fault rate 
for access time that is not more than 200 nanoseconds.

Sol:
	Tnotmodified=  8ms
	Tmodified 	=20ms
	Maccess		=100ns

	P(Page moddified)=70%=0.7
	Therfore,Q=1-P=0.3

	So, Average time in cae of a page fault,Tpf =p(Tmodified)+q(Tnotmodified)+Maccess
												=0.7(20ms)+0.3(8ms)+100ns
												=14ms+2.4ms+0.1ms
												=16.5ms

	let P be the requred probability of acceptable page faults.
	Therefore,
		200ns>=(1-P)100ns+P(16.5ms)
		200ns>=100ns+P(-100ns+16.5ms)
		100ns>=P(16400ns)
		P<=100/16600
		P<=0.00609756
		  ~0.61%
